GASTON is on pypi: https://pypi.org/project/gaston-spatial/.

pip install gaston-spatial

You can also directly install the conda environment from the environment.yml file:

cd GASTON
conda env create -f environment.yml
Then install GASTON using pip.

conda activate gaston-package
pip install -e .
Installation should take <10 minutes.

We will add GASTON to bioconda soon!

Getting started
Check out our readthedocs, which includes tutorials for four analyses:

mouse cerebellum (Slide-SeqV2)
human colorectal tumor (10x Visium)
human breast cancer tumor (10x Xenium)
mouse cortex (MERFISH).
Training GASTON by following the tutorials should take <1 hour.

GASTON requires an NxG gene expression matrix (e.g. UMI counts) and an Nx2 spatial location matrix, which can be provided or read from Space Ranger output.

The data to run the tutorials is located in docs/notebooks/tutorials/. Note that due to Github size constraints, you have to download the counts matrices for both analyses from Google Drive.
