   "source": "# Step 4: Processing GASTON Neural Network Output\n\n## What is this step doing?\n\nAfter Step 3, we have **30 independently trained bottleneck autoencoders** per slice, each producing a scalar **isodepth** $d_i$ for every spot $i$. This step turns those raw model files into interpretable spatial domain labels, and evaluates quality against expert-annotated ground truth.\n\nThere are three sub-tasks here:\n\n1. **Model selection** — pick the best of the 30 restarts\n2. **Isodepth extraction + domain segmentation** — convert the scalar isodepth into discrete layer labels using breakpoint detection (dynamic programming)\n3. **Evaluation** — compare predicted domains to the DLPFC ground-truth annotations using ARI and NMI\n\n---\n\n## Sub-task 1: Model Selection\n\n**Strategy A — pick by reconstruction loss** (`process_NN_output.process_files`)  \nThe GASTON library loads all 30 `min_loss.txt` files and returns the model with the lowest final MSE. This is the standard approach: lower reconstruction loss = better fit to the data.\n\n**Strategy B — pick by ARI against ground truth** (used later in this notebook)  \nSince we have expert annotations, we can also iterate over all 30 reps, extract domains for each, and pick the rep with the highest ARI. This is 'oracle' selection — it uses labels we wouldn't have in a real unsupervised setting, but it gives an upper bound and is useful for ablations.\n\n---\n\n## Sub-task 2: Isodepth → Domain Labels\n\nThe decoder $h_\\psi : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{14}$ is a **piecewise-linear curve** in embedding space (because it's a ReLU MLP from a 1D input). The breakpoints of this curve correspond to **transitions between tissue layers**.\n\n`dp_related.get_isodepth_labels(model, A, S, num_layers)` runs **dynamic programming** to find the optimal `num_layers - 1` breakpoints along the isodepth axis that minimize within-segment variance. This is analogous to 1D k-means with an optimal merge criterion.\n\nThe output is:\n- `gaston_isodepth` — the scalar $d_i$ for each spot (a continuous value)\n- `gaston_labels` — integer domain label 0..K-1 for each spot (discrete, from breakpoint detection)\n\n**Design choice:** `num_layers = 7` is hardcoded here because we know the DLPFC has 6 cortical layers + white matter. In a real unsupervised setting, you would use `model_selection.plot_ll_curve` to estimate the number of domains from a likelihood curve (like an elbow/BIC plot for k-means).\n\n---\n\n## Sub-task 3: Evaluation — ARI and NMI\n\n**ARI (Adjusted Rand Index)**: Measures agreement between two clusterings, corrected for chance. Range: [-1, 1], higher is better. ARI = 1 means perfect agreement. Random clusterings give ARI ≈ 0.\n\n**NMI (Normalized Mutual Information)**: Measures shared information between two clusterings, normalized to [0, 1]. Higher is better. NMI = 1 means perfect agreement.\n\nBoth metrics are **permutation-invariant** — they don't care which integer label maps to which layer, only whether the partitioning agrees.\n\n---\n\n## Could we replace the whole GASTON pipeline with PCA / NMF / scVI?\n\nYes — and running these as baselines is exactly the kind of ablation that makes a strong project. The table below compares GASTON against what you would get if you used standard ML tools from EECS 545 for spatial domain detection:\n\n| Method | Embedding (replaces Step 2) | Clustering (replaces Steps 3+4) | Key limitation vs. GASTON |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **PCA + Leiden** | PCA on log-normalized counts | k-NN graph → Leiden clustering | PCA assumes Gaussian noise; Leiden ignores spatial coordinates |\n| **NMF + k-means** | NMF gives non-negative topic scores per spot | k-means on topic vectors | No spatial constraint; topics may not align with layer ordering |\n| **scVI + Leiden** | VAE with Negative Binomial likelihood | Leiden on latent embedding | scVI ignores (x,y) coordinates entirely |\n| **STAGATE** | Graph attention autoencoder on spatial neighbors | Leiden on latent | No continuous isodepth; layer ordering not explicitly learned |\n| **GASTON (ours)** | GLM-PCA (Step 2) | Bottleneck autoencoder on (x,y) → isodepth → DP segmentation | Assumes 1D dominant structure |\n\n**What makes GASTON different** from all of the above is the **bottleneck constraint**: it forces the model to explain all expression variation with a *single* spatial axis anchored to (x,y) coordinates. This is a strong inductive bias — it works well when the tissue has a dominant 1D structure (like cortical layers running top-to-bottom), and would struggle on tissues with more complex 2D spatial organization.\n\nAny of the alternatives above are valid baselines. Comparing GASTON ARI against PCA+Leiden ARI is a clean one-script experiment to add to the paper.\n\n---\n\n## Why this step matters for the C-GASTON project\n\n**This step establishes the baseline ARI that C-GASTON has to beat.**\n\nThe whole point of C-GASTON is to ask: *does adding H&E image features to the encoder improve spatial domain detection?*\n\nThe pipeline comparison:\n\n```\nGASTON (baseline, Steps 1-4):\n  Gene counts → GLM-PCA → A (N×14)\n  Spatial coords (x,y) ──────────→ Encoder φ_θ: R² → R  →  isodepth d_i\n                                    Decoder h_ψ: R  → R^14 →  reconstructed A\n  → domain labels (DP)  →  ARI ← THIS NOTEBOOK measures this number\n\nC-GASTON (proposed):\n  Gene counts → GLM-PCA → A (N×14)\n  Spatial coords (x,y)  ─┐\n  H&E patch features (f) ─┴→ Encoder φ_θ: R^(2+d) → R  →  isodepth d_i\n                               Decoder h_ψ: R        → R^14 →  reconstructed A\n  → domain labels (DP)  →  ARI ← same evaluation; expect this number to go up\n```\n\nThe **only change** between GASTON and C-GASTON is the encoder input: `(x, y)` → `(x, y, f)` where `f` is a feature vector from the H&E image patch at that spot's location.\n\n**Why would H&E features help?**  \nH&E contains morphological information invisible to gene expression alone — cell density, cell size, nuclear staining intensity, tissue architecture. Different DLPFC layers look visually distinct (e.g., Layer 4 has densely packed granule cells; white matter is pale with axon bundles). If the encoder can leverage this signal, it should learn an isodepth that more cleanly separates layers, especially at layer boundaries where gene expression transitions are gradual.\n\n**How to extract H&E patch features (the vision branch):**\n- For each spot $i$, crop a patch centered at its `(imagerow, imagecol)` pixel location in the high-resolution H&E image\n- Feed each patch through a pretrained vision encoder: ResNet-50, ViT-B/16, or a pathology-specific model (UNI, CONCH, PLIP)\n- Output: feature vector $\\mathbf{f}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., $d = 512$ for ResNet, $d = 768$ for ViT-B)\n- Concatenate: encoder input = $[\\,x_i,\\; y_i,\\; \\mathbf{f}_i\\,] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2+d}$\n\n**Optional: contrastive regularization (InfoNCE)**  \nBeyond simply concatenating features, C-GASTON can add a contrastive loss to explicitly align the isodepth with H&E similarity:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i \\|\\mathbf{a}_i - h_\\psi(d_i)\\|^2}_{\\text{reconstruction (GASTON)}} + \\lambda \\cdot \\underbrace{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{InfoNCE}}(d_i,\\, \\mathbf{f}_i)}_{\\text{align isodepth with H\\&E}}$$\n\nThe contrastive term pulls together spots whose H&E patches look similar (should share the same layer) and pushes apart spots with visually different patches. This is analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning from EECS 545, applied here to enforce consistency between the visual and genomic signals.\n\n**Step 4 is unchanged in C-GASTON** — once we have the trained model, the DP segmentation and ARI/NMI evaluation are identical. The only question is whether the ARI numbers go up."
